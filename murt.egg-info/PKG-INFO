Description: # MURT
        
        Multipath Radio Tracer (MURT) is a ray-tracing engine for multipath propagation of radio wave. MURT is a Python package which consits of ray-tracing engine, visualisation, path loss calculator, and the customized OpenAI Gym for machine learning implementations.

        ## Get Started
        
        MURT consists of multiple tools. Each tool can be called and used separately.
        
        ### Ray Tracing Core
        
        The core engine only accepts the triangulated obj files to the tracing process.
        
        ```Python
        from murt import tracer
        
        # Scene File Path in obj
        OBJ_FILE_PATH =  "file_path.obj"
        
        # Initialize Tracer
        my_tracer = tracer(OBJ_FILE_PATH)
        # Set transmiting position
        tx_pos = [ 0, 15, 0]
        # Set receiving position
        rx_pos = [-30, 1.5, 45]
        
        # Return the traced paths
        result = my_tracer.trace(tx_pos, rx_pos)
        ```
        
        The result is the list of traced paths. The first position of the tuple indicates types of the paths (1 - direct path, 2 - diffracted path, 3 - reflected path).
        
        ### Calculate Path Loss
        
        As the possible paths are traced from the engine. the results from the tracer can be used to
        
        ```Python
        
        
        ```
        
        ### Visualiser
        
        ```
        
        ```
        
        #### Random
        
        ```
        
        
        ```
